# AI Learning Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains interactive Jupyter notebooks that complement the AI learning guide. Each notebook allows you to run the code examples and experiment with the concepts interactively.

## Notebooks Overview

1. `01_foundational_terms.ipynb` - Covers basic AI terminology with interactive examples
2. `02_training_concepts.ipynb` - Demonstrates training-related concepts you can run and modify
3. `03_model_structure.ipynb` - Explores transformer architecture with visual examples
4. `04_advanced_concepts.ipynb` - Provides hands-on experiments with advanced AI techniques

## How to Use These Notebooks

1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed:
   ```
   pip install jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install torch transformers matplotlib numpy seaborn datasets
   ```

3. Start Jupyter:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Navigate to each notebook and run the cells sequentially.

The notebooks are designed to be both educational and interactive. Feel free to modify the code and experiment to deepen your understanding.
