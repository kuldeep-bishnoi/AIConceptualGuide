# AI Learning Resources

This directory contains comprehensive notes on AI and machine learning concepts, ideal for quick reference and learning.

## Directory Structure

- `README.md` - This overview file
- `01_foundational_terms.md` - Basic terminology for beginners
- `02_training_concepts.md` - Intermediate training-related concepts
- `03_model_structure.md` - Transformer architecture and model structure
- `04_advanced_concepts.md` - Advanced AI techniques and optimizations
- `notebooks/` - Interactive Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning

## How to Use These Notes

1. **For Beginners**: Start with `01_foundational_terms.md` to understand the basic vocabulary of AI.
2. **For Intermediate Learners**: Once comfortable with the basics, move to `02_training_concepts.md`.
3. **For Advanced Study**: Proceed to `03_model_structure.md` and `04_advanced_concepts.md`.
4. **For Hands-on Learning**: Explore the `notebooks/` directory to run the code examples interactively.

## Using the Jupyter Notebooks

The notebooks directory contains interactive versions of all the learning material. This is the best way to learn the concepts as you can run and modify the code examples.

### Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the notebooks directory:
   ```
   cd notebooks
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   python3 setup.py
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open any of the notebooks and start experimenting!

### GPU Acceleration

For information on setting up GPU support for faster model training and inference, see the `notebooks/GPU_SETUP.md` guide.

## What Makes These Notes Special

- **Code Examples**: Each concept includes practical Python code examples
- **Clear Explanations**: Concise definitions and explanations without unnecessary jargon
- **Progressive Learning**: Organized from basic to advanced topics
- **Visual Learning**: Uses formatting to highlight important concepts
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Run and experiment with the code examples
